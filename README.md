# Random Walks

A basic simulation of evolution under brownian motion with a boundary condition. The `randomwalk.html` output is built from `randomwalk.rmd` with the excellent package `knitr` via RStudio. Custom css styling was incorporated per http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/custom-css-for-html-generated-using-rstudio/ .
